## 📋 Project Overview

**InsightBoard** is a modern, responsive Admin Dashboard built to demonstrate **advanced Front-end Engineering skills**. 

The goal of this project was to build a scalable UI architecture using **React** and **TypeScript**, focusing on reusable components, strict type safety, and a seamless user experience across devices. It simulates a real-world SaaS environment with data visualization, list management, and user preferences.

### ✨ Key Technical Features

- **⚛️ Component-Driven Architecture:** Built with atomic, reusable components (e.g., `StatCard`, `StatusBadge`, `Switch`) to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- **🛡️ Strict TypeScript:** Full type safety for all data interfaces (Users, Sales, Transactions) to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.
- **📊 Dynamic Data Visualization:** Integration of `Recharts` for performant, responsive charts (Area & Bar) with custom tooltips and gradients.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a fluid layout from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
- **⚡ Efficient State Management:** Handling complex form states and UI toggles (Settings Page) with React Hooks.
- **🧩 Clean Routing:** Implementation of `React Router v6` with nested routes for a structured application flow.
